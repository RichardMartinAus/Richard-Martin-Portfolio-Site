# Portfolio Website

## A professional and responsive portfolio page

Our task was to create a professional looking webpage to display our body of work. The site needs to look good, function well and be accessible across multiple devices and screen-sizes. 

I began by building the basic structure of the website in HTML using as many semantic HTML elements as possibe. Once the HTML was coded, the real fun started with the CSS styling! Each element was styled to fall within the brief, while also expressing my own personality and love for colour. Once I was happy with how the site looked on a desktop screen, I went through and added media queries to resize and adjust the layout of the pages to be mobile-friendly. I used media queries to adjust the layout on when viewed on tablets and a range of mobile phone screens too. 

I've tried to add some personal touches to the site, including vector artwork that I have created and a custom favicon. 

The work section will become populated with real, deployed apps as they are built. Currently only one of the apps is live and deployed, so placeholders have been used to simulate the final layout.

Here's a link to the deployed site: [https://richardmartinaus.github.io/richard-martin-portfolio-site/](https://richardmartinaus.github.io/Richard-Martin-Portfolio-Site/) 

Below is a screenshot of the deployed page.
